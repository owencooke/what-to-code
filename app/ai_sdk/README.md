# LangChain.js x AI SDK

This directory contains two pages with demo implementations of using [LangChain.js](https://js.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/) and [AI SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai) in [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components).

Each directory contains a `README.md` file which documents exactly what is happening in the code. The README will break down each component of the server -> client data streaming process, and explain how to set up the necessary tools and models.

### [Agents](./agent/README.md)

### [Tools](./tools/README.md)
